//! In this module we design another multi-user currency system. This one is not based on
//! accounts, but rather, is modelled after a paper cash system. The system tracks individual
//! cash bills. Each bill has an amount and an owner, and can be spent in its entirety.
//! When a state transition spends bills, new bills are created in lesser or equal amount.
